# Fetch Debitoor

This is an alternative to [`debitoor`](https://github.com/debitoor/node-debitoor) with the key difference
being that fetch-debitoor is built on the [`node-fetch`](https://github.com/bitinn/node-fetch) library.

## Usage

```
yarn add fetch-debitoor
```
or
```
npm install --save fetch-debitoor
```

Everything else is like using plain fetch except that you're expected to provide only relative URLs
and authentication is handled for you.
